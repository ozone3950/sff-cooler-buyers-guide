# SFF Cooler Buyer's Guide

Small form factor systems come in various shapes and sizes. The sections of this guide will be split into categories based on the size/clearence of the coolers, since cases usually specify compatibility in this way. However, note that not all SFF cases require low profile coolers.

`"What is SFF?"`

"SFF" is an abbreviation for Small Form Factor. SFF systems are builds that have a volume of under 20L.

`"Why should I go SFF?"`

ITX is an underrated platform that many people do not know in depth about. Small form factor cases can be very space efficient and transportable, even with no compromises. 

`"What is 'ITX Tax?"`

'ITX Tax' is a term used regarding the extra cost of going the ITX route. ITX systems do usually cost more, but noawadays it's not bad at all. It can definitely be worth it if you want to go this route.



# <75mm Coolers 

## Jonsbo CR-701
- 75mm tall
- 33mm memory clearence
- 120mm RGB PWM fan
- 5 heatpipes
- 19.5-29.2 dBA noise level

##### Notes:

Great value cooler with a great sized heatsink. However, the fan is quite loud. This cooler with a fanswap would be a great idea for a low price.

## Noctua L12S
- 70mm tall 
- 48mm memory clearence
- NF-A12x15 PWM fan
- 4 heatpipes
- 16.8 - 23.9 dBA noise level

##### Notes: 

Great sized heatsink with a good, quiet fan. The cooler comes with NT-H1, which is great thermal paste.

## Noctua L9x65
- 65mm tall
- Unlimited memory clearence
- NF-A9x14 PWM fan
- 4 heatpipes
- 14.8 - 23.6 dBA noise level 

##### Notes:

Great heatsink for a cooler that supports unlimited memory clearence, and a quiet fan. This also comes with NT-H1 thermal paste.

## Scythe Big Shuriken 3
- 69mm tall 
- Unlimited memory clearence
- Kaze Flex 120mm Slim PWM fan
- 5 heatpipes
- 2.7 - 30 dBA noise level 

##### Notes:

While having the biggest heatsink out of the bunch that has unlimited memory clearence, it also includes a 120mm Kaze Flex Slim, which gives this cooler great thermals in relation to noise in combination with the heatsink.

## Verdict:

The best choice here is the Scythe Big Shuriken 3. Probably the best performance with very quiet accousitcs, whilst still having unlimited memory clearence.



# <47mm Coolers 

## Alpenföhn BLACK RIDGE
- 47mm tall
- 33mm memory clearence
- 92mm FDB PWM fan
- 6 heatpipes
- 14 - 37.6 dBA noise level 

##### Notes: 

The most customizable coolers out of the options. Even though the fan is still good, it's possible to mount a 120mm fan ontop of the cooler instead, if you have any clearence left.

## Alpenföhn Silveetta
- 45mm tall
- Unlimited memory clearence
- 92mm HDB PWM fan
- 3 heatpipes
- 14 - 37.6 dBA noise level

##### Notes:

Slightly smaller than the BLACK RIDGE with a very similar fan, the performance isn't too far off that cooler. An upside is that this cooler has unlimited memory clearence and the BLACK RIDGE does not.

## CRYORIG C7
- 47mm tall
- Unlimited memory clearence
- 92mm fan
- 4 heatpipes
- 30 dBA noise level 

##### Notes:

Another decent cooler with unlimited memory clearence. However, the fan is not PWM and is on the louder side. It also has pretty poor mounting. 

![c7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91910634/145461114-048ce360-da3d-4f4a-99f7-0a20ee70f443.png)


## Jonsbo HP-400
- 36mm tall
- Unlimited memory clearence 
- 90mm HDB PWM fan
- 4 heatpipes
- 14 - 33 dBA noise level 

##### Notes:

Great value cooler with unlimited memory clearence coming in handy again. Like the CR-701, a fanswap would be a good option. This is the only cooler here that also comes in a blue coloured heatsink.

## Noctua L9a / L9i
- 37mm tall 
- Unlimited memory clearence
- NH-A9x14 PWM fan
- 2 heatpipes
- 14.8 - 23.6 dBA noise level

##### Notes:

Thin with a quiet fan, and the only cooler to have its heatpipes this way. This is done so it can have a bigger heatsink, since it nearly makes direct contact with the CPU. This also has unlimited memory clearence, and does come with NT-H1 thermal paste.

![l9ia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91910634/145447967-21ce393b-83f2-4127-aa42-83fb64a64284.png)


## Thermalright AXP-90
- 47mm tall
- Unlimited memory clearence 
- Thermalright TL-9015 PWM fan 
- 4 heatpipes
- 22.4 dBA noise level 

##### Notes:

Usually the cheapest out of them all, this cooler has very good performance for the price, has a good quiet fan, and unlimited memory clearence.

![axp90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91910634/145448633-c6870c0a-febe-4e78-a13c-98f607d26822.png)


## Verdict:

This category goes to the Alpenföhn BLACK RIDGE. Great performance included with a decent fan, and great customizability.
